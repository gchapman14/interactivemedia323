	 	<div id=L1>
	 	The people upstairs all practise ballet
Their living room is a bowling alley </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	 	<div id=L2> Their bedroom is full of conducted tours.
Their radio is louder than yours, </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

	 	<div id=L3> They celebrate week-ends all the week.
When they take a shower, your ceilings leak. </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

	 	<div id=L4> They try to get their parties to mix
By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks, </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

	 	<div id=L5> And when their fun at last abates,
They go to the bathroom on roller skates. </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

	 	<div id=L6> I might love the people upstairs more
If only they lived on another floor. </div>
