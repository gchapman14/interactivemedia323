<div class="pogo"> The people upstairs all practise ballet
<br>
<br>
Their living room is a bowling alley
<br>
<br>
Their bedroom is full of conducted tours.
<br>
<br>
Their radio is louder than yours,
<br>
<br>
They celebrate week-ends all the week.
<br>
<br>
When they take a shower, your ceilings leak.
<br>
<br>
They try to get their parties to mix
<br>
<br>
By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,
<br>
<br>
And when their fun at last abates,
<br>
<br>
They go to the bathroom on roller skates.
<br>
<br>
I might love the people upstairs more
<br>
<br>
If only they lived on another floor. </div>
