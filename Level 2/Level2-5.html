	 	<h2> The people upstairs </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>all practise ballet </li>

	 	<h2> Their living room </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li> is a bowling alley </li>

	 	<h2> Their bedroom </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li> is full of conducted tours. </li>

	 	<h2> Their radio </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>is louder than yours, </li>

	 	<h2> They celebrate </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>week-ends all the week. </li>

	 	<h2> When they take a shower, </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>your ceilings leak. </li>

	 	<h2> They try to get their parties to mix </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li> By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks, </li>

	 	<h2> And when their fun at last abates, </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>lThey go to the bathroom on roller skates. </li>

	 	<h2> I might love the people upstairs more </h2>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li>If only they lived on another floor.</li>
