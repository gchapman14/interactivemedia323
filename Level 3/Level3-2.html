<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp all practise ballet
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Their living room 
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp is a bowling alley
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Their bedroom is full of conducted tours.
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Their radio is louder than yours,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They celebrate week-ends all the week.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When they take a shower, your ceilings leak.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They try to get their parties to mix
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And when their fun at last abates,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They go to the bathroom on roller skates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I might love the people upstairs more
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If only they lived on another floor. </div>
